Ayurvedic Medicine Recommendation System:
Developed an advanced and comprehensive system designed to recommend Ayurvedic medicines based on detailed analysis of symptoms and references from classical texts like Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita. The system uses algorithms to match user-provided symptoms with treatments mentioned in these ancient texts, ensuring authentic and precise suggestions.

Backend Development: Implemented the backend logic using Python and the Django framework, which provided a robust and scalable infrastructure to handle large volumes of user queries and database interactions. Key functionalities include symptom parsing, text-based pattern recognition, and medicine suggestion algorithms. The backend was optimized for performance to ensure quick response times and reliability.

Full-Stack Development: Designed and developed the system's front end using HTML and CSS, creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. The intuitive design allows users to input symptoms effortlessly and navigate the system without technical difficulties.

Database Management: Utilized SQLite during development and transitioned to MySQL for production to handle larger datasets efficiently. These databases store structured information about Ayurvedic medicines, their properties, indications, and references to classical texts. The database architecture ensures fast and accurate retrieval of medicine suggestions while supporting scalability as the system grows.

This project integrates the wisdom of Ayurveda with modern technology, providing an accessible and scientifically structured solution for Ayurvedic medicine recommendations.
